    "The only data needed for this lab is the `books.xml` file, which can be dowloaded from this GitHub repo.\n",

    "# JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is JSON and why are we learning about it\n",
    "\n",
    "1. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is as popular way to format data as a single (purportedly human-readable) string. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. JavaScript programs use JSON data structures, but we can frequently encounter JSON data outside of a JavaScript environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Websites that make machine-readable data available via an application programming interface (API- more on these in an upcoming lab) often provide that data in a JSON format. Examples include Twitter, Wikipedia, Data.gov, etc. Most live data connections available via an API are provided in a JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. JSON structure can vary WIDELY depending on the specific data provider, but this lab will cover some basic elements of working with JSON in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The easiest way to think of JSON data as a plain-text data format made up of something like key-value pairs, like we've encountered previously in working with dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Example JSON string: `stringOfJsonData = '{\"name\": Zophie\", \"isCat\": true, \"miceCaught\": 0, \"felineIQ\": null}'`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. From looking at the example string, we can see field names or keys (`name`, `isCat`, `miceCaught`, `felineIQ`) and values for those fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. To use more precise terminology, JSON data has the following attributes:\n",
    "- uses name/value pairs\n",
    "- separates data using commas\n",
    "- holds objects using curly braces `{}`\n",
    "- holds arrays using square brackets `[]`\n",
    "\n",
    "9. In our example `stringOfJsonData`, we have an object contained in curly braces. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. An object can include multiple name/value pairs. Multiple objects together can form an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Values stored in JSON format must be one of the following data types:\n",
    "- string\n",
    "- number\n",
    "- object (JSON object)\n",
    "- array\n",
    "- boolean\n",
    "- null\n",
    "\n",
    "12. How is data stored in a JSON format different than a CSV? \n",
    "\n",
    "13. A `.csv` file uses characters as delimiters and has more of a tabular (table-like) structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. JSON data uses characters as part of the syntax, but not in the same way as delimited data files. \n",
    "\n",
    "15. Additionally, the data stored in a JSON format has values that are attached to names (or keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "16. JSON can also have a hierarchical or nested structure, in that objects can be stored or nested inside other objects as part of the same array.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. For example, take a look at sapmle JSON data from Twitter's API:\n",
    "```JSON\n",

    "42. Unlike HTML which allowed us to mark up and display information, XML is used for descriptive standards. \n",
    "\n",
    "43. For information professionals that work in places like libraries, XML is commonly associated with metadata--the descriptive information needed to describe information. That is, XML is used to encode metadata. \n",
    "\n",
    "44. Another example of digital work built on XML falls under the umbrella of the [Text Encoding Initiative](https://tei-c.org/), a group that’s been around since the 1970s and the early days of digital humanities. TEI includes a standardized set of tags that are used for marking or encoding various parts of a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "45. Sample projects that use TEI:\n",
    "- [Digital Archives and Pacific Culture](http://pacific.pitt.edu/InjuredIsland.html)\n",
    "- [The Digital Temple](https://digitaltemple.rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/)\n",
    "- [The Diary of Mary Martin](https://dh.tcd.ie/martindiary/)\n",
    "- [Toyota City Imaging Project](http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/toyota/)\n",
    "- [African American Women Writers](http://digital.nypl.org/schomburg/writers_aa19/)\n",
    "- [The Walt Whitman Archive](https://whitmanarchive.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "46. XML is designed to store and transport data, it does not DO anything - XML is simply information that is wrapped in a set of tags. \n",
    "\n",
    "47. These tags can be user defined or from a standardized schema (like TEI). \n",
    "\n",
    "48. So, users of XML are free to develop their own set of tags or content standards in XML to describe whatever kind of information they would like.\n",
    "\n",
    "49. The root element is the `parent` element to all of the other elements within an XML document. \n",
    "\n",
    "50. The elements are arranged hierarchically: `parent` elements have `child` elements, `child` elements have `sibling` or `subchild`’ elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "51. The indentation is used to indicate the hierarchical structure of an XML document. \n",
    "\n",
    "52. NOTE: XML tags are case sensitive. This matters when we are working in Python to isolate specific components or elements in XML data.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. General XML structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```XML\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n",
    "<root>\n",
    "  <child>\n",
    "    <subchild>xome text</subchild>\n",
